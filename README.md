# ⚛️ React25

A structured React refresh focused on **building real projects** that reinforce fundamentals and progressively advance toward expert-level React patterns.

This repository documents my deliberate effort to sharpen React proficiency through hands-on development rather than isolated theory.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to:

* Re-establish a strong and intuitive understanding of React’s core principles
* Build confidence through practical, project-driven learning
* Progress methodically from foundational concepts to advanced architectural patterns
* Write cleaner, more scalable, and production-minded React code

Each project serves as a checkpoint in mastering React concepts that are commonly used in real-world applications.

## 📚 Learning Scope

Projects in this repository are intentionally organized to span the full React learning spectrum.

### 🧱 Core Fundamentals

* JSX and component architecture
* Props, state, and reactivity
* Event handling and user interaction
* Conditional rendering
* Rendering lists and managing keys
* Styling fundamentals

### ⚙️ Intermediate React

* Core hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
* Component composition and state lifting
* Controlled forms and input handling
* Side effects and basic async logic
* File and project structure best practices

### 🚀 Advanced Patterns

* `useReducer` for complex state logic
* Custom hooks and abstraction
* Context API for shared state
* Performance optimization techniques
* Scalable component and state architecture

---

## 🧠 Development Philosophy

* Learn by building, not memorizing
* Favor clarity over cleverness
* Emphasize maintainability and scalability
* Apply patterns that translate directly to production environments

As the repository evolves, project complexity and architectural decisions become increasingly intentional.
