## 🧩 The Process

1. Set up the project using **Vite + React** for a fast development environment
2. Broke the UI into reusable components:

   * `Header` for branding
   * `UserInput` for handling form inputs
   * `Results` for displaying calculated data
3. Managed application state in the main `App` component
4. Passed data and handlers between components using **props**
5. Centralized investment calculation logic in a utility file for better separation of concerns
6. Added conditional rendering to handle invalid input states

## 📚 What I Learned

* Strengthened understanding of **React component composition**
* Practical use of the **`useState` hook** for managing complex state objects
* Passing and updating state via **props and callback functions**
* Implementing **conditional rendering** based on derived state
* Separating business logic from UI using utility functions
* Writing cleaner, more maintainable React code
